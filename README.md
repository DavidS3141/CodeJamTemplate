# CodeJamTemplate
A template for the Google Code Jam Contest and the (now scrapped) Distributed Version. Feel free to fork and share.
Contains code from high ranking contestants condensed together. Sadly I forgot from whom I took the basis of the
Code Jam Template (but most of it I wrote by my own anyway), but the Distributed is tweaked of by the solutions of bmerry submitted DCJ World Finals 2016.

# Todos
- [ ] implement python template as well (potentially helpful for big ints, string manipulation and other convenient stuff)
- [ ] make the create script more safe so that no present code gets overwritten
- [x] adapt to new Code Jam Interactive Problem structure
